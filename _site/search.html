Customize the invisibles and tab spacing in Atom:  Adjust the display for auto-complete  Show files listed in .gitignore  Atom Shortcuts  Atom Snippets  Use SnippetsIf you haven’t downloaded Atom, download and install it. Use this as your editor when working with Jekyll. The syntax highlighting is probably the best among the available editors, as it was designed with Jekyll-authoring in mind. However, if you prefer Sublime Text, WebStorm, or some other editor, you can also use that.Customize the invisibles and tab spacing in Atom:  Go to Atom &gt; Preferences.  On the Settings tab, keep the default options but also select the following:          Show Invisibles      Soft Wrap      For the Tab Length, type 4.      For the Tab Type, select soft.      Adjust the display for auto-completeIf you don’t adjust the timing on the auto-complete, the constant prompts from the editor get annoying. At the same time, when you want the prompts, it’s extremely helpful to have this feature.  Go to Atom &gt; Preferences.  Click the Packages tab.  Search for autocomplete-plus.  In the Display Before Suggestions Shown box, type 300.  In the Keymap for Confirming a Suggestion box, select tab and enter.Show files listed in .gitignoreBy default, files listed in .gitignore will be hidden from view in Atom. You can adjust this by doing the following:  Go to Atom &gt; Preferences.  Click the Packages tab.  Search for Tree View package.  Click Settings.  Clear the check box that says Hide VCS Ignored Files.Atom Shortcuts  Cmd + T: Find file  Cmd + Shift + F: Find across project  Cmd + Alt + S: Save all(For Windows, replace “Cmd” with “Ctrl”.)Atom SnippetsYou can use a number of shortcuts with Atom. These shortcuts are entered as snippets. You have to enter these shortcuts manually in your Atom editor.Use SnippetsSnippets expand stored text from a keyword shortcut. For example, if you type ximage and then press Enter, it expands to {% include image.html  file=”” max-width=”” border=””  url=”” caption=”” alt=”” %}  assuming you have this snippet configured.To configure snippets:  Copy the snippets file in assets/snippets.txt.  In Atom, go to Atom &gt; Snippets.  Replace the existing snippet contents with the content you pasted. Make sure your cursor is flush left before pasting the content.Here are the shortcuts:  xtoc  xfront  xcallout  xnote  xtip  xcaution  xwarning  xlinks  ximage  xinline_image  xaudio  xbookmark  xcomment  xcode  xnavtabs  xtableTo insert the code from the snippet, type the shortcut and press Enter. Note that you have to be in a Markdown file for the snippets to work. The snippets are associated with Markdown files.If you have the “autocomplete plus” package turned on in Atom, you’ll see prompts when you enter this text. You can also add your own shortcuts to your snippets file by following the same format.",

You should also use Bundler to be sure that you have all the required gems and other utilities on your computer to make the project run.  Ruby and RubyGems  Install Homebrew  Install Ruby through Homebrew  Serve the Jekyll Documentation themeRuby and RubyGemsRuby and RubyGems are usually installed by default on Macs. Open your Terminal and type which ruby and  which gem to confirm that you have Ruby and Rubygems. You should get a response indicating the location of Ruby and Rubygems.If you get responses that look like this:/usr/local/bin/rubyand/usr/local/bin/gemGreat! Skip down to the Bundler section.However, if your location is something like /Users/MacBookPro/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/gem, which points to your system location of Rubygems, you will likely run into permissions errors when trying to get a gem. A sample permissions error (triggered when you try to install the jekyll gem such as gem install jekyll) might look like this for Rubygems: &gt;ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)  You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0 directory.Instead of changing the write permissions on your operating system’s version of Ruby and Rubygems (which could pose security issues), you can install another instance of Ruby (one that is writable) to get around this.Install HomebrewHomebrew is a package manager for the Mac, and you can use it to install an alternative instance of Ruby code. To install Homebrew, run this command:/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"If you already had Homebrew installed on your computer, be sure to update it:brew updateInstall Ruby through HomebrewNow use Homebrew to install Ruby:brew install rubyLog out of terminal, and then then log back in.When you type which ruby and which gem, you should get responses like this:/usr/local/bin/rubyAnd this:/usr/local/bin/gemNow Ruby and Rubygems are installed under your username, so these directories are writeable.Note that if you don’t see these user-specific paths, try restarting your computer. If you’re still having trouble, try making these directories writeable. If that still doesn’t work, try installing rbenv, which is a Ruby version management tool. If you still have issues getting a writeable version of Ruby, you need to resolve them before installing Bundler.Install the Jekyll gemAt this point you should have a writeable version of Ruby and Rubygem on your machine.Now use gem to install Jekyll:gem install jekyllServe the Jekyll Documentation theme  Browse to the directory where you downloaded the Documentation theme for Jekyll.

        "content": " Tip: For a better terminal emulator on Windows, use Git Bash. Git Bash gives you Linux-like control on Windows.Install RubyFirst you must install Ruby because Jekyll is a Ruby-based program and needs Ruby to run.  Go to RubyInstaller for Windows.  Under RubyInstallers, download and install one of the Ruby installers (usually one of the first two options).  Double-click the downloaded file and proceed through the wizard to install it.Install Ruby Development KitSome extensions Jekyll uses require you to natively build the code using the Ruby Development Kit.  Go to RubyInstaller for Windows.  Under the Development Kit section near the bottom, download one of the For use with Ruby 2.0 and above… options (either the 32-bit or 64-bit version).  Move your downloaded file onto your C drive in a folder called something like RubyDevKit.  Extract the compressed folder’s contents into the folder.      Browse to the RubyDevKit location on your C drive using your Command Line Prompt.    To see the contents of your current directory, type dir. To move into a directory, type cd foldername, where “foldername” is the name of the folder you want to enter. To move up a directory, type cd ../ one or more times depending on how many levels you want to move up. To move into your user’s directory, type /users. The / at the beginning of the path automatically starts you at the root.    Type ruby dk.rb init  Type ruby dk.rb installIf you get stuck, see the official instructions for installing Ruby Dev Kit.Install the Jekyll gemAt this point you should have Ruby and Rubygem on your machine.Now use gem to install Jekyll:gem install jekyllYou can now use Jekyll to create new Jekyll sites following the quick-start instructions on Jekyllrb.com.Git Clients for WindowsAlthough you can use the default command prompt with Windows, it’s recommended that you use Git Bash instead. The Git Bash client will allow you to run shell scripts and execute other Unix commands.Serve the Jekyll Documentation theme  Browse to the directory where you downloaded the Documentation theme for Jekyll.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).Heading level 1this is some body content.Heading level 2this is some body content.Heading level 3this is some body content.Heading level 4this is some body content.Heading level 5this is some body content.Bold contentThis is a bold word.ItalicsThis is an italic word.Inline CodeThis is some inline code in a sentence.Code blocksThis is a code block:---title: My File Namepermalink: myfile.htmlsidebar: mysidebarproduct: My Product---This is a code block with pre tags:- title: Sample Topic  jurl: /sample.html  hurl: /solutions/devices/product/docs/sample  ref: sampleBulleted ListsThis is a bulleted list:  first item  second item  third itemNumbered listThis is a simple numbered list:  First item.

Inside your project folder, you can organize your pages in any of subdirectories you want. As long as each page has a permalink property in the front matter, the pages will be moved into the root directory and flattened (that is, pulled out of any subdirectories) when your site builds.Pages and Front matterEach Jekyll page (which uses an .md extension) has front matter at the top set off with three hyphens at the top and bottom. The front matter for each page should look like this:---title: My File Namepermalink: myfile.htmlsidebar: mysidebarproduct: My Product---You can store the sidebar and product properties as defaults in your _config.yml file if you want. See the defaults property there.If you have a colon in your title, put the title’s value in parentheses, like this:---title: \"ACME: A generic project\"permalink: myfile.htmlsidebar: mysidebarproduct: My Product---The layout property for the sidebar is specified in the configuration file’s defaults. _config.yml specifies a Jekyll layout (default.html).The format for any content in the front matter must be in YAML syntax. You can’t use Liquid or other {{ }} syntax in your front matter. (In other words, no variables in YAML.)The permalink should match your file name exactly, and it should include the html file extension (even if your file is markdown).Markdown FormattingJekyll uses kramdown-flavored Markdown. You can read up more on kramdown and implement any of the techniques available. Some templates for alerts and images are available.On-Page Table of ContentsTo add a table of contents in your topic, add this formatting where you want the table to appear:* TOC{:toc}Additionally, add this into your frontmatter:If you don’t have `` in your frontmatter, the TOC won’t show up in the layout.HeadingsUse pound signs before the heading title to designate the level. Note that headings must have one empty line before and after the heading.## Second-level headingResult:Second-level heading### Third-level headingResult:Third-level heading#### Fourth-level headingResult:Fourth-level headingYou can also use the Setext style headers if you want. If you’re converting content to Markdown from Word docs using Pandoc, Pandoc will use the Setext style header markup. This means level 2 headers will be underlined rather than containing the ## markup:Second level header-------------------Result:Second level headerFirst level headers are underlined with an equals sign (but since h1 headings are used only for the doc title, not any subheadings within the doc, you won’t see them). Levels beyond 2 use the regular pounds signs (###) for markup.Bulleted ListsThis is a bulleted list:*  first item*  second item*  third itemUse two spaces after the asterisk.Result:  first item  second item  third itemNumbered listThis is a simple numbered list:1.  First item.2.  Second item.3.  Third item.Use two spaces after each numbered item (until number 10, then use 1 space). You can use whatever numbers you want — when the Markdown filter processes the content, it will correctly sequence the list items.Result:  First item.  Second item.  Third item.You can control numbering with this syntax on the line preceding a list item: {:start=\"3\"}Complex ListsHere’s a more complex list:1.  Sample first item.    * sub-bullet one    * sub-bullet two2.  Continuing the list    1.  sub-list numbered one    2.  sub-list numbered two3.  Another list item.Result:      Sample first item.          sub-bullet one      sub-bullet two            Continuing the list          sub-list numbered one      sub-list numbered two            Another list item.  Another Complex ListHere’s a list with some intercepting text:1.  Sample first item.    This is a result statement that talks about something....2.  Continuing the list    {% include note.html content=\"This is a sample note. If you have \\\"quotes\\\", you must escape them.\" %}     Here's a list in here:    * first item    * second item3.  Another list item.    ```js    function alert(\"hello\");    ```4.  Another item.Result:      Sample first item.    This is a result statement that talks about something….        Continuing the list     Note: Remember to do this. If you have “quotes”, you must escape them.    Here’s a list in here:          first item      second item            Another list item.    function alert(\"hello\");            Another item.  Key Principle to Remember with ListsThe key principle is to line up the first character after the dot following the number:Lining up the left edge ensures the list stays intact.For the sake of simplicity, use two spaces after the dot for numbers 1 through 9. Use one space for numbers 10 and up. If any part of your list doesn’t align on this left edge, the list will not render correctly.AlertsFor alerts, use the alerts templates, like this:{% include note.html content=\"This is a note.\" %}Result: Note: This is a note.{% include tip.html content=\"This is a tip.\" %}Result: Tip: This is a tip.{% include warning.html content=\"This is a warning.\" %}Result: Warning: This is a warning.{% include important.html content=\"This is important.\" %}Result: Important: This is important.Alerts have just one include property: content. If you need to use quotation inside the content quotation marks, escape the quotation marks by putting back slashes (\\) before them.{{{% include warning.html content=\"This is a \\\"serious\\\" warning.\" %}Result: Warning: This is a “serious” warning.Note that you can use Markdown syntax inside of your alerts. (You don’t need to add markdown=\"span\" tags anywhere, since they’re already included in the alert templates.)CalloutsCallouts are similar to alerts but are intended for longer text. A callout simply has a left border that is a specific color. The color uses Bootstrap’s classes.{% include callout.html content=\"This is my callout. It tends to be a bit longer, and provides less visual attention than an alert. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a new paragraph.\" type=\"info\" title=\"Sample Callout\" %}Sample CalloutThis is my callout. It tends to be a bit longer, and provides less visual attention than an alert. Here is a new paragraph.Parameters are as follows:            Property      Description      Required                  content      The content for the parameter.      Required              type      The color for the callout. Options are info, warning, danger, success, primary, default.      Required              title      A title for the callout. The color matches the type property.      Required      As with alerts, you can use Markdown inside of callouts.Using Variables Inside Parameters with IncludesSuppose you have a product name or some other property that you’re storing as a variable in your configuration file, and you want to use this variable in the content parameter for your alert. You will get an error if you use Liquid syntax inside a include parameter. For example, this syntax will produce an error:{% include note.html content=\"The {{site.company}} is pleased to announcean upcoming release.\" %}To use variables in your include parameters, you must use the “variable parameter” approach. First you use a capture tag to capture some content. Then you reference this captured tag in your include. Here’s an example.In my site configuration file, I have a property called myvariable.myvariable: ACMEI want to use this variable in my note include.First, before the note, capture the content for the note’s include like this:{% capture company_note %}The {{site.myvariable}} company is pleased to announce an upcoming release.{% endcapture %}Now reference the company_note in your include parameter like this:{% include note.html content=company_note}Result: Note: The  company is pleased to announce an upcoming release.Note the omission of quotation marks with variable parameters.Also note that instead of storing the variable in your site’s configuration file, you could also put the variable in your page’s front matter. Then instead of using {{site.myvariable}}, you would use {{page.myvariable}}.LinksThere are several types of links:  Cross-References  Bookmark Links on the Same Page  Links to External Web Resources  Links to Sections on Other PagesCross-ReferencesTo link one documentation topic to another inside the same project (internal cross references, not links to external web resources), don’t use manual Markdown links. Instead, use an automated ref property that is generated from the _include/links.html file (which loops through your sidebar and gets all the ref properties).This automated approach is more efficient and easier than manual Markdown link formatting. Additionally, it is the only way to scale link paths for translation projects.For each item in your sidebar menu, include a ref property like this:- title: Sample Topic  jurl: /sample.html  hurl: /solutions/devices/product/docs/sample  ref: sampleThen open your _config.yml file and make sure your project’s sidebar name is included in the sidebars property.The file that generates the links (_includes/links.html) iterates through the sidebar data files (all the ones listed in your configuration file, that is) and constructs a list of Markdown reference-style links.(The forward slash (/), which is listed in the sidebar data file’s jurl property, gets removed from the Jekyll links, which allows links to be relative. It’s included in the sidebar data file to facilitate menu highlighting.)On each of your pages, you must include the links.html file at the bottom of the content:{% include links.html %}  Note: If your links don’t work, check to see whether you remembered to include the links.html file at the bottom of each topic.When you add the {% include links.html %} reference at the end of the topic, it’s the equivalent of adding a Markdown reference-style links like this:[sample]: somelink.htmlYou won’t actually see this referent on your page because it all happens in the build process. (The links.html file dynamically builds all the ref instances and then inserts this content at the bottom of the page, and then the Markdown filter process the content, converting it to HTML and inserting links where the references appear.) Tip: When you choose the ref values in your sidebar file, use the same names as your files. Otherwise it gets confusing to try to match up ref values with the right files.You can see the output of links.html by looking at the linkstest.html file in the _site directory after your site builds. It should include your pages in Markdown reference style formatting. This is what gets inserted at the bottom of every page when you build your Jekyll site.Bookmark Links on the Same PageIf you want to link to a heading on the same page, first add an ID tag to the header like this:## Headings with ID Tags {#someIdTag}Then reference it with a normal Markdown link:[Some link](#someIdTag)Result:Some linkLinks to Sections on Other PagesSuppose you want to link to a specific section heading on another page.First create a heading ID for the section you want to link to. On the Getting started page, there are some headings like this:## My updates {#updates}## Text editors {#editors}Now add a bookmarks property to the entry in the sidebar data file and include all the heading ID tags on that page that you want to link to inside brackets.    - title: My Page Name      jurl: /acme-mypage-name.html      hurl: /some/long/path/acme-mypage-name      ref: acme-mypage-name      bookmarks: [updates, editors]The links.html file will automatically create Markdown link references for any strings in the bookmarks array.Use the following syntax for your link Markdown referent:Here's a list of [editors you can use][acme-mypage-name#editors].(The syntax actually resembles the same syntax for bookmark links, though the link is actually just a string.)The links.html file will create references that look like this in the build:[getting-started#editors]: getting-started.html#editorsResult:Here’s a list of [editors you can use][getting-started#editors].Links to External Web ResourcesFor links to external web resources, just use regular Markdown style links using an absolute URL:See the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/index.html).Result:See the Android documentation.If links to external resources clutter the text, you can use Markdown reference style links instead of putting the URLs inline.Example:See the [ColorFilterDimmer][cfdim] class and the [codim][ColorOverlayDimmer] class in the Android documentation....[cfdim]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/vr/VrListenerService.html[codim]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v17/leanback/graphics/ColorOverlayDimmer.htmlResult:See the Android documentation. Tip: If the link formatting doesn’t render correctly in your output, something is wrong with the link. Check to make sure you included the links.html file at the bottom of the file, and that your referent is correct.Detecting Broken LinksIf you have an error with your Markdown link reference, kramdown won’t process the link. For example, suppose you referred to the link like this:See the [instruction for image borders][image-borders].In this example, let’s say the real ref value is imageborders (without the hyphen). As a result, putting image-borders will result in no link.Result:See the [instruction for image borders][image-borders].To check for broken links in your output, do a search for ][ in your _site directory (restricting the search to *.html files only in the _site directory). The ][ is a unique syntax that is unlikely to be used in many other places, and can indicate a broken link.If you find a broken link, here are main causes:  You forgot to add the {% include links.html %} at the bottom of the file.  The Markdown referent you’re using doesn’t match the ref name in your sidebar data file.Detecting broken links across the entire siteTo check for broken links across the entire site, use the Broken Link Checker tool. For URLs that are listed as containing broken links, go to the page. Then use the Check My Links Chrome extension to identify the broken link on the page.Content re-use (includes)To re-use content, store the content in your _includes folder inside the content subfolder:Then use the include tag to reference the file. Here’s an example:{% include content/myfile.md %} Content stored in _includes will be available to include in any page. To avoid naming conflicts with any includes in the gem-theme, include your product’s name in the file name of your include.Note that if you have an include that is only included in the same folder, you can use the include_relative tag and then put the included file in the same folder (rather than storing it in _includes). However, the include_relative tag can’t reference a file that is stored outside of the folder (with ../ syntax). (You can reference subfolder locations, though.)VariablesTo use a variable, add the variable and its value to your config files, like this:myvariable: ACMEThen reference the property through the site namespace:{{site.myvariable}}Result:All properties in your configuration files are available through the site namespace. (Note that if you add values to your configuration files,  you must restart Jekyll for the changes to take effect.)All properties in the page’s front matter are available through the page namespace.If you have a lot of variables, you could also store them in the _date folder (for example, _data/myvars.yml). Then you would reference them through the site.data namespace (for example, site.data.myvars.myvariable).Audio IncludesIf you have an audio file that you want to include, you can use the audio include. Audio includes work similar to images. Here’s an example:{% include audio.html title=\"Example: Basic Punctuation\" file=\"jekyllhowto/audio/great\" type=\"mp3\" %}The parameters of the include are as follows:            Parameter      Description                  title      A title tag for the element. Optional. This tag might be useful for SEO, but the title does not appear anywhere in the audio player’s display.              file      The name of the audio file, without the file extension.              type      The extension for the file.      Single sourcingSuppose you have content that you want to push out to multiple files. But there are some differences that each destination page should have.Create the include as usual. Where you want to differentiate the content, you could add this:{% if include.device == \"product_a\" %}Say this for product A only...{% endif %}When you call the include, pass this parameter into the include:{% include content/{{site.language}}/myfile.md device=\"product_a\" %}Code SamplesFor code samples, use fenced code blocks with the language specified, like this:```jsconsole.log('hello');```Result:console.log('hello');For the list of supported languages you can use and the official abbreviations, see Supported languages.Jekyll applies syntax highlighting using a stylesheet that color codes the text based on the language.If you want to make specific text red inside a code sample (leaving all other text black), use pre tags instead of backticks, and then use &lt;span class=\"red\"&gt; tags inside the code.For example, suppose you want to call attention to a particular line in a code example, in this case, console.log. You can apply a red class to that content to make it more apparent:&lt;pre&gt;if (chocolate == \"healthy\") {   chocolate = chocolate + 10000;   &lt;span class=\"red\"&gt;console.log(\"chocolate healthy: \" + chocolate);&lt;/span&gt;   }else (chocolate == \"unhealthy\") {   chocolate = chocolate + 50000;   &lt;span class=\"red\"&gt;console.log(\"chocolate unhealthy: \" + chocolate);&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;Result:if (chocolate == \"healthy\") {   chocolate = chocolate + 10000;   console.log(\"chocolate healthy: \" + chocolate);   }else (chocolate == \"unhealthy\") {   chocolate = chocolate + 50000;   console.log(\"chocolate unhealthy: \" + chocolate);}Note that double curly braces {{ }} are reserved characters, so you cannot actually use them in code samples. If you have double curly braces, surround them with raw tags like this:&#123;% raw %&#125;{{ }}&#123;% endraw %&#125;Jekyll will not process any logic inside of raw tags.If your code sample is XML, this approach using &lt;pre tags won’t be enough. You’ll need to escape all the HTML and leave the &lt;span&gt; tags unescaped.Note that currently there’s a bug with Liquid when using the highlight tag for code samples within lists. If you run into this issue, use the fenced code block (with backticks) instead of using the highlight tag.Markdown TablesYou can use standard Markdown syntax for tables:| Priority apples | Second priority | Third priority ||-------|--------|---------|| ambrosia | gala | red delicious || pink lady | jazz | macintosh || honeycrisp | granny smith | fuji |Result:            Priority apples      Second priority      Third priority                  ambrosia      gala      red delicious              pink lady      jazz      macintosh              honeycrisp      granny smith      fuji      However, Markdown tables don’t give you control over the column widths. Additionally, you can’t use block level tags (paragraphs or lists) inside Markdown tables, so if you need separate paragraphs inside a cell, you must use &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.If you want to add a class to the table in Markdown, add a tag like this:{: .mystyle}| Priority apples | Second priority | Third priority ||-------|--------|---------|| ambrosia | gala | red delicious || pink lady | jazz | macintosh || honeycrisp | granny smith | fuji |This will create a table with a class of mystyle.You could then add an embedded style for mystyle:&lt;style&gt;.mystyle th {   font-weight: bold;}&lt;/style&gt;HTML TablesIf you need a more sophisticated table syntax, use HTML syntax for the table. Although you’re using HTML, you can use Markdown inside the table cells by adding markdown=\"span\" as an attribute for the td, as shown in the following table. You can also control the column widths through the colgroup properties. Here’s an example:&lt;table&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col width=\"60%\" /&gt;&lt;col width=\"40%\" /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;To create…&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Use this skill type&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td markdown=\"span\"&gt;A skill that can handle just about any type of request.For example:- Look up information from a web service- Integrate with a web service to order something (order a car from Uber, order a pizza from Domino’s Pizza)- Interactive games- Just about anything else you can think of&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td  markdown=\"span\"&gt;Custom skill (*custom interaction model*)See [Sample 3][sample3]...(more content...)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td  markdown=\"span\"&gt;...(content in second row, first column)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td  markdown=\"span\"&gt;...(content in second row, second column)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Result:To create…Use this skill typeA skill that can handle just about any type of request.For example:- Look up information from a web service- Integrate with a web service to order something (order a car from Uber, order a pizza from Domino’s Pizza)- Interactive games- Just about anything else you can think ofCustom skill (custom interaction model)See Sample 3…(more content…)…(content in second row, first column)…(content in second row, second column)To make life easier, add the following into a template that you can easily trigger through Atom’s snippet feature:&lt;table&gt;   &lt;colgroup&gt;      &lt;col width=\"40%\" /&gt;      &lt;col width=\"60%\" /&gt;   &lt;/colgroup&gt;   &lt;thead&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;         &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;/thead&gt;   &lt;tbody&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;One-off StylesIf you have a need to implement a custom style within your Markdown content, first define the style through some style tags:&lt;style&gt;.special {   font-family: Gothic;   font-size: 40px;   font-color: red;   }&lt;/style&gt;Then apply the class with this syntax:{: .special}My special class.Result:My special class.You can also use ID tags instead of classes:{: #special}My special class.You can have an empty line between the class or ID tag ({: #special}) and the next element. This technique will apply the class or ID attribute on whatever element comes next in your document.ImagesTo insert an image into your content, use the image.html include template that is set up:{% include image.html file=\"company_logo.png\" url=\"http://developer.company.com\" alt=\"My alternative image text\" caption=\"This is my caption\" border=\"true\" max-width=\"90%\" %}Result:This is my captionThe image include’s properties are as follows:            Property      Description      Required?                  file      The name of the file (include the file extension)      Required              url      Whether to link the image to a URL      Optional              alt      Alternative image text for accessibility and SEO      Optional              caption      A caption for the image      Optional              border      A border around the image. If you want the border, set this equal to true. Otherwise omit the parameter.      Optional              max-width      You can use px or a percentage, such as 70px.      Optional      The image template will use the image_path property when referencing the path to the image.Store images in the images folder in your Jekyll project — these images will be used for your Jekyll output.Media Central will cache images you upload and expire the cache on an hourly basis. The first time you upload an image to Media Central, you may need to wait a few minutes before it becomes available.Excluding Images from Translated BuildsIf you want to have some images appear only in certain languages, use conditional logic:{% if site.language == \"english\" %}{% include image.html file=\"company_logo.png\" url=\"http://dev.company.com\" alt=\"My alternative image text\" border=\"true\" caption=\"This is my caption\" %}{% endif %}Including Inline ImagesFor inline images, such as with a button that you want to appear inline with text, use the inline_image.html include, like this:Click the **Android SDK Manager** button {% include inline_image.html file=\"androidsdkmanagericon.png\" alt=\"SDK button\" border=\"true\" max-width=\"90%\" %}Result:Click the Android SDK Manager button The inline_image.html include properties are as follows:            Property      Description      Required                  file      The name of the file (include the file extension)      Required              alt      Alternative image text for accessibility and SEO      Optional              border      A border around the image. If you want the border, set this equal to true. Otherwise omit the parameter.      Optional              max-width      A maximum width for the image. You can use px or a percentage, such as 70px.      Optional      Bold, ItalicsYou can make content bold with two asterisks (**bold**), or italics with one asterisk (*italics*).Question and Answer formattingYou can use the following formatting for Q&amp;A pages:Why is the sky blue?:  It's not actually blue. This is an illusion based on the way molecules in our atmosphere reflect light waves.Why is the ocean blue?:   It reflects the color of the atmosphere.Result:  Why is the sky blue?  It’s not actually blue. This is an illusion based on the way molecules in our atmosphere reflect light waves.  Why is the ocean blue?  It reflects the color of the atmosphere.If you want to emphasize the question aspect, put a “Q:” before the questions:Q: Why is the sky blue?:  It's not actually blue. This is an illusion based on the way molecules in our atmosphere reflect light waves.Q: Why is the ocean blue?:   It reflects the color of the atmosphere.Result:  Q: Why is the sky blue?  It’s not actually blue. This is an illusion based on the way molecules in our atmosphere reflect light waves.  Q: Why is the ocean blue?  It reflects the color of the atmosphere.kramdown outputs this Markdown syntax as a definition list in HTML.Glossary PagesTo list the terms from a glossary, first list the terms in a YAML data file inside the _data folder, like this:-  term: macabre  def: ghastly, horrifying, resembling death-  term: riparian  def: on the bank by a riverSupposing the glossary file were named glossary.yml, you could list out the terms like this:{% assign glossaryTerms = site.data.glossary %}&lt;dl&gt;    {% for entry in glossaryTerms %}    &lt;dt id=\"{{entry.term}}\"&gt;{{entry.term}}&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;{{entry.def}}&lt;/dd&gt;    {% endfor %}&lt;/dl&gt;Result:                            The terms will be sorted according to their order in the glossary.yml file, so you have to manually alphabetize the terms. (Liquid’s sort filter doesn’t mix capitalized and lowercased terms when alphabetizing items, so you can’t use it here unless you only have lowercase or only have uppercase terms.)Each definition term will have an ID tag (based on id=\"{{entry.term}} in the previous code). If you want to link to this term, add each glossary term to the bookmarks property in your glossary entry in your sidebar navigation. For example:    - title: Glossary      jurl: /glossary.html      hurl: /solutions/devices/glossary      ref: glossary      bookmarks: [mcabre, riperian]Then make links in your content like this:Result:For more information, see [Riperian][glossary#riperian].TooltipsYou can leverage your glossary for tooltips by using the tooltips.html include. Here’s an example:The setting was {% include tooltips.html term=\"riperian\" capitalize=\"true\" %} to say the least.I cannot believe she described this canal trail as {% include tooltips.html term=\"riperian\" %} in the book.Result:The setting was Riparian to say the least.I cannot believe she described this canal trail as riparian in the book.By default, the glossary term is lower-cased. If you want it capitalized, add a capitalize=\"true\" parameter in the include syntax.Note the following about links and formatting in the tooltips.yml file:  You can’t add hyperlinks in YAML content using the approach for automated links (such as [jekyllhowto-publishing][jekyllhowto-publishing]), but you can directly code HTML links here.  In your link formatting, use single quotes instead of double quotes. For example, &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River'&gt;River in Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.  For multiple paragraphs, use &lt;p&gt; tags. Other HTML formatting is also allowed.  You can’t use includes or variables in your glossary.yml file.  Enclose the def values in quotation marks to avoid conflicts with colons, which are illegal characters in YAML syntax. For quotation marks inside quotations, escape them /\"like this/\".To implement the tooltip on a page, reference it through the tooltips.html include:The parameters of the tooltips include are as follows:            Parameters      Description                  term      The glossary term in the glossary.yml file              capitalize      Include only if you want the term capitalized. If so, set it equal to true and treat as a string. (A capitalization filter gets placed on the glossary term.) If you omit the term, no capitalization filter gets applied to the term. If the term is capitalized, you don’t need to also apply this filter.      NavtabsYou can implement nav tabs when you have different code samples or instructions based on programming languages or platforms, and you want to put the information in a more compressed space. Here’s the HTML code:&lt;ul id=\"profileTabs\" class=\"nav nav-tabs\"&gt;  &lt;li class=\"active\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"noExtIcon\" href=\"#firsttab\" data-toggle=\"tab\"&gt;First Tab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=\"noExtIcon\" href=\"#secondtab\" data-toggle=\"tab\"&gt;Second Tab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=\"noExtIcon\" href=\"#thirdtab\" data-toggle=\"tab\"&gt;Third Tab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=\"noExtIcon\" href=\"#fourthtab\" data-toggle=\"tab\"&gt;Fourth Tab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=\"tab-content\"&gt;  &lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane active\" id=\"firsttab\"&gt;    &lt;div class=\"subheading\"&gt;First Tab    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Note the following:  If you’re adding more tabs, be sure to customize the id value for each tabpanel div to match up with the href value for the list item (li) classes. In this code, you can see that firsttab in the href value matches up with the firsttab value for the div with the tab-pane class.  You can use Markdown instead of HTML inside the &lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane active\" id=\"profile\" markdown=\"block\"&gt; by adding markdown=\"block\" as an attribute. This tells kramdown to process the content as block level element with Markdown. If you just want a span element, use markdown=\"span\".  Don’t use heading levels (such as h2) within the tabs. If you do, the heading levels will appear in the mini-TOC and the links won’t jump to anywhere. Instead, use a subheading class on a div tag as shown in the example.  You can store the tab content in a separate file and pull it in. For example, you might store the tab content for the first tab in a file called firsttab.yml. Store this tab in the same directory as your file with the navtab. Now reference the content with this: {% include_relative firsttab.yml %}.If you have a code sample inside a navtab, put the code flush against the left edge and inside a surrounding element that specifies markdown=\"block\". Here’s an example:&lt;p markdown=\"block\"&gt;&#96;&#96;&#96;json\"notificationInfo\": {        \"notificationType\": \"OrderPlacedNotification\",        \"lwaClientId\": \"amzn1.application-oa2-client.6b68exxxxxxxxxx9\",        \"notificationTime\": \"2016-12-02T21:09:58.689Z\",        \"notificationId\": \"amzn1.dash.notification.v1.xxxxxxxxxxxxx13\",        \"version\": \"2015-06-05\"    }&#96;&#96;&#96;&lt;/p&gt;Workflow MapsYou can include a simple linear workflow map that has squares at the top depicting a process. Add the following in your page’s frontmatter:simple_map: truemap_name: &lt;filename.html&gt;Inside the _includes folder (create one if you don’t have one), create the referenced map_name file and follow this format:&lt;div id=\"userMap\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"file-1.html\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"box box1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"stepName\"&gt;STEP 1:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Download the Project&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"arrow\"&gt;→&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"file-2.html\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"box box2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"stepName\"&gt;STEP 2:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Configure the Settings&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"arrow\"&gt;→&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"file-3.html\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"box box3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"stepName\"&gt;STEP 3:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Run the Installer&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Customize the text and links that you want. Note that you can’t use automated links here. You have to hard-code the links in HTML.Also note that you can’t have too many workflow squares (the max is 5-6).",

        "content": "You can generate a PDF of your Jekyll project. The PDF uses Prince XML to generate the PDF and allows you to configure which pages you want printed. The PDF output includes a table of contents for the entire guide, a mini-TOC on each section page, page numbers in cross references, and running headers and footers. The styling uses Bootstrap’s CSS for print styles. You can see a sample here: Jekyll How-to Guide (PDF).  Generate a PDF of All Docs in a Sidebar  Generate a PDF of a Single Page  Modify the Print Styles  Change the PDF Styles  Change the PDF’s Headers or Footers  Troubleshooting  Analyzing the OutputGenerate a PDF of All Docs in a Sidebar  Install Prince XML:          MacOS instructions      Windows instructions        Create a configuration file for the PDF output. Copy the _config_pdf_jekyllhowto.yml file and rename it to match your project’s name (e.g., (_config_pdf_&lt;myproject&gt;.yml).  Open the configuration file and customize the following values:          print_title: Appears on the PDF’s title page and running header.      print_subtitle: Appears on the PDF’s title page.      sidebar: Used to generate the table of contents and mini-TOC.      folderPath: The folder path to your site output (for example, /Users/tomjoht/projects/devcomm-appstore-v2/_site). Prince needs this absolute path to access the files.      copyright_notice: The copyright statement that you want to appear in the manual.            Open your sidebar data file and add the following section after folders:    folders:- title: Frontmatter  jurl: /frontmatter.html  type: frontmatter  pdf: true  folderitems:  - title: Title page    jurl: /pdf_title_page.html    pdf: true  - title: Copyright page    jurl: /pdf_copyright_page.html    pdf: true  - title: TOC page    jurl: /pdf_toc_page.html    pdf: true        Add a new property for each section title and page called pdf: true for all the pages you want included in the PDF. Follow the example in the previous code sample. Alternatively, look at _data/jekyllhowto.yml file.      Organize your pages into subfolders by section. (Sections are the folders title that contains folderitems, or the subfolders title that contains subfolderitems, etc.)    For example, if your product nav has the folders “Getting Started” and “Configuration”, create folders inside the _docs folder named “Getting Started” and “Configuration”. Group the pages within those sections into those folders.        For each folder, add a new page that will serve as the mini-TOC for that section. Call it something that like **minitoc_.md**.     Tip: It might be helpful to organize your pages into subfolders by section. All files get flattened into the root directory when your site builds, so it doesn’t matter how many subfolders you use to organize your content.        Open up each mini-TOC file and add the following, customizing the frontmatter values for your own project:    ---title: Get Startedpermalink: /iap-minitoc-get-started.htmlsidebar: in_app_purchasing---{% include pdfminitoc.html %}        The title should be the same as the section title in your sidebar table of contents. The permalink should match your file name. The sidebar corresponds to your product sidebar.     Note: Be careful with your file names here. If you mistype a file name, the PDF won’t build and you’ll have to sort out the cause of the error later. In fact, Prince is much more exacting about only generating a PDF if all listed assets are available. You’ll likely encounter some errors in the PDF generation process that stem from unavailable files or mistyped names in your sidebar data file. Think of these errors as helpful validation.        Open up your sidebar data file (in the _data folder) and add a jurl property for each section entry, like this:    - title: Jekyll Project Setup  jurl: /jekyllhowto-project-setup.html  pdf: true  folderitems:        Point the jurl value to your mini-TOC file.See the _data/jekyllhowto.yml file for an example.        Open up the first file in your table of contents (after the Frontmatter section). Add class: first in the page’s frontmatter.    ---title: Jekyll Project Setuppermalink: /jekyllhowto-minitoc-project-setup.htmlsidebar: jekyllhowtoclass: first---        This property will reset the numbering so that the first page begins on “1” (after the lower-roman number numbering for the TOC and frontmatter section.)    Before running Prince, we need to build an HTML-friendly output for Prince to consume. This HTML-friendly output will apply the layout that we want reflected in the print material.        Create a Jekyll server shortcut file to build the PDF-friendly output that the Prince script will consume. Copy serve_pdf_jekyllhowto.sh and customize the file name with your own project. Open the file and customize the PDF file name to match your PDF configuration file:    jekyll serve --config _config_pdf_jekyllhowto.yml            Create a build shortcut file to make it easy to run Prince to generate the PDF. Copy build_pdf_jekyllhowto.sh and customize the file name with your own project. Open the file and customize the PDF file name (change jekyllhowto.pdf):    echo \"Building the PDF ...\";prince --javascript --input-list=_site/assets/prince-list.txt -o pdf/jekyllhowto.pdf;echo \"Done. Look in the /pdf folder in your project directory.\";        The prince-list.txt file contains scripts that iterate through your sidebar data file and gather links to all the pages to consolidate in the PDF. The -o parameter specifies the file name and location Prince should write the PDF file to. If you’re having trouble with pages appearing, you can check prince-list.txt in your _site/assets output and make sure a valid link to the file exists on the page. The --input-list parameter in the above command is the input source for Prince.  Building the PDF      From the command line, build the HTML output that uses your PDF configuration file:    . serve_pdf_jekyllhowto.sh        (Use the custom Jekyll server shortcut you created earlier.)        When the server preview finishes, open another tab and build the PDF:    . build_pdf_jekyllhowto.sh        You don’t need to have Jekyll server running to build the PDF. But it’s helpful in case you build the PDF and notice some issues you want to fix.    If successful, you’ll see a message like this:    Building the PDF ...Done. Look in the /pdf folder in your project directory.        (Actually, the message will appear even if the build is unsuccessful — it just lets you know the process finished.)    Look in the root directory of your project (not the _/site folder), look for your PDF.  Generate a PDF of a Single PageIf you just want to create a simple PDF of one page in your docs, you can skip most of the steps in the previous section. To generate a PDF of a single doc:  Complete steps 1 through 3 in the previous section, Generate a PDF of All Docs in a Sidebar.      Build the HTML-friendly version of the site:    jekyll serve --config _config_pdf_jekyllhowto.yml            From the command line, navigate to the _site folder. Then run this:    prince --javascript jekyllhowto-content-and-formatting.html -o pdf/jekyllhowto-content-and-formatting.pdf;        In this case, the page being converted to PDF is jekyllhowto-content-and-formatting.html. Replace this with the page you want.  Modify the Print StylesThe print styles are defined in assets/css/pdf/printstyles.css. To overwrite the styles:      Copy the contents of printstyles.css, which is packaged in the gem.    To get the contents of the file, run bundle show documentation-theme-jekyll-multioutput from your Jekyll project directory. Go to the path shown and open the assets/css/pdf/printstyles.css file.        Copy and paste the contents of printstyles.css into a new file called user_defined_pdf_styles.css. Put user_defined_pdf_styles.css file into a folder called assets/css/pdf in your Jekyll project.    This will overwrite the user_defined_pdf_styles.css file (which is blank) in the gem’s files. This gem file is a placeholder intended to accommodate custom styles. It is referenced in the PDF layout files.        Change the styles as desired. See CSS Properties for a list of styles supported by Prince XML.  Change the PDF StylesDoes a style not look right? Do you want to customize the headers or footers for a specific page? You can do so by modifying the print stylesheet: assets/css/pdf/printstyles.css.You can simply add regular CSS here as you want. See CSS Properties on the Prince XML site for supported properties.Change the PDF’s Headers or Footers  Follow the instructions in the previous section, Change the PDF Styles.      In your PDF configuration file (e.g., _config_pdf_jekyllhowto.yml), in the defaults section, add a class as a default to your /_docs and pages. For example:    defaults:  -    scope:      path: \"\"      type: pages    values:      layout: printpdf      class: myclass  -    scope:      path: \"\"      type: docs    values:      layout: printpdf      class: myclass        This will add a default class property and value to your page’s frontmatter, like this:    ---class: myclass---            Open the user_defined_pdf_styles.css file and define the style like this:    body.myclass { page: myclass }@page myclass {    @top-left {        content: \" \";    }    @top-right {        content: prince-script(datestamp);    }    @bottom-right {        content: counter(page, lower-roman);    }    @bottom-left {        content: prince-script(guideName);        font-size: 11px;    }}        See the Page Selectors topic in the Prince XML documentation for more details.    The datestamp and guideName functions are special Prince functions defined in the printpdf.html layout (packaged in the assets/pdf folder of the gem). Other JavaScript generated content is also possible. See the Prince XML site for details.  TroubleshootingIf you see an error that Prince can’t load an input file, it means one of the files in the list is incorrectly named. For example, you might see this error after running your . build_pdf_jekyllhowto.sh command:prince: /Users/tomjoht/projects/myapp/_site/jekyllhowto-minitoc-getting-started.html: error: can't open input file: No such file or directoryIf you see this error, look to make sure the file appears in the _site directory and is properly named. Check the permalink name of the file as well as its name in the sidebar menu file (e.g., _data/jekyllhowto.yml).You might also get errors if you have JavaScript or non-allowed CSS syntax in your content.Analyzing the OutputLook at the PDF. Check the display of your tables, images, code samples, and other formatting. Look at the running header and footer, as well as the title page, table of contents, and mini-TOC pages. Does it all look good? If so, great.If you need to conditionalize some content so that it doesn’t appear in the guide, you can use an if condition like this:{% unless site.format == \"pdf\" %}This won't appear in the guide....{% endunless %}unless acts like a negative. You would read the above like this: Run this code unless site.format equals pdf.You can also conditionalize your content using this syntax:{% if site.format == \"web\" %}This won't appear in the guide....{% endif %}The configuration file for the Jekyll and Hippo outputs contains format: web. The configuration file for PDFs contains format: pdf.",

      "jekyllhowto-sidebar-navigation-html": {
        "title": "Sidebar Navigation",
        "tags": "[]",
        "content": "The output for the sidebar navigation gets generated from the sidebar yaml file in the _data folder. YAML files don’t use markup tags but rather spacing to create syntax. Look carefully at the YAML syntax in the sample generic.yml  or jekyllhowto.yml files. The syntax for your YAML content must be correct in order for the files to be valid.  How the Sidebar Works  Entries in the Sidebar  Adding Additional Resources  Sidebar Object Hierarchy  Level Requirements  Customize the HeaderHow the Sidebar WorksThe theme contains a file called _includes/sidebar.html that uses “for” loops to iterate through the items in this YAML file and push the content into an HTML format. When Jekyll builds your site, the sidebar gets included into each page. This means each page has its own copy of the sidebar code when the site builds.Entries in the SidebarEach entry in the sidebar files includes four properties — title, jurl, hurl, and ref. These properties stand for the page title, Jekyll URL, hard-coded URL, and the Markdown referent for linking. Here’s an example:    - title: Sample1      jurl: /sample.html      hurl: /solutions/widgets/acme/docs/sample      ref: sample1 Note: The hurl value is optional. This is used only in systems where the relative URL may not work. Some server environments require the absolute, hard-coded URL to the page. If so, you can use this hurl value. (Unless you have an odd publishing system, you probably won’t use hurl and can omit it.)            Property      Description                  title      The page title.              hurl      The hard-coded (absolute) URL to your content. (This is only required if you’re publishing to a system that requires hard-coded URLs. Otherwise, omit this.)              jurl      The Jekyll URL. Use a relative link that begins with a / and includes only page’s filename, not the folders. Use the “.html” file extension (even if your file has an .md extension in the source).              ref      The shortname used to create the Markdown link references. This is a friendly way to refer to the page. You use this value as the Markdown referent when inserting links in your content.      The ref property is like a variable used to refer to either the hurl or jurl property, depending on which configuration file you use when building your Jekyll project.Adding Additional ResourcesIf you want to add some additional resources, such as to forums or other documentation, you can add them in a Related Resources section below the sidebar.Here’s an example:###########################related_resources_title: Other Resourcesrelated_resources_list:- title: Forums  hurl: https://some.developer.forum.com/- title: More Documentation  hurl: https://more.documentation.company.com- title: Documentation Portal  hurl: https://my.documentation.portalThe sidebar will show this information below the sidebar.Sidebar Object HierarchyIn addition to the properties required for each entry, sidebar entries must appear in the following hierarchy:folders:- title: Theme documentation  folderitems:  - title: Homepage    jurl: /index.html    hurl: https://docs.mycompany.com/index    ref: home  - title: Getting Started    jurl: /getting-started.html    hurl: https://docs.mycompany.com/getting-started.    ref: home- title: Sample Folder Title  folderitems:  - title: Sample1 level1    jurl: /sample.html    hurl: https://docs.mycompany.com/solutions/widgets/acme/docs/sample    ref: sample1  - title: Sample2 level1    jurl: /sample2.html    hurl: https://docs.mycompany.com/solutions/widgets/acme/docs/sample2    ref: sample12    subfolders:    - title: Another level deep      output: web      subfolderitems:      - title: Some content        jurl: /sublevel1.html        hurl: https://docs.mycompany.com/solutions/widgets/acme/docs/sublevel1        ref: sublevel1      - title: Some more content        jurl: /sublevel2.html        hurl: https://docs.mycompany.com/solutions/widgets/acme/docs/sublevel2        ref: sublevel2        subsubfolders:        - title: Last level deep          output: web          subsubfolderitems:          - title: Some content last level            jurl: /subsublevel1.html            hurl: https://docs.mycompany.com/solutions/widgets/acme/docs/subsublevel1            ref: sample          - title: Some more content last level            jurl: /subsublevel2.html            hurl: https://docs.mycompany.com/solutions/widgets/acme/docs/subsublevel2            ref: sampleAs you can see, there’s a folders object that contains folderitems. Inside folderitems is another level called subfolders, which contains subfolderitems.Below subfolders is another level called subsubfolders, which contains subssubfolderitems. Each new level begins on a new line two spaces out from the previous one. The general hierarchy looks like this:folders:  folderitems:    subfolders:      subfolderitems:Don’t change any of these object names that indicate the levels. The theme’s template files use a for loop to iterate through this structure based on these object names.Level RequirementsNote that you must have items at each level. If you want to have a folder that contains other folders and no individual items, you must add a - at that level. For example:folders:- title: My parent folder  folderitems:  -    subfolders:    - title: My child folder 1      output: web      subfolderitems:      - title: Some content        jurl: /sublevela.html        hurl: https://docs.mycompany.com/i/solutions/widgets/acme/docs/sublevela        ref: sublevela    - title: My child folder 2      output: web      subfolderitems:      - title: Some content        jurl: /sublevelb.html        hurl: https://docs.mycompany.com/i/solutions/widgets/acme/docs/sublevelb        ref: sublevelbThis structure looks like this:├── My parent folder│   ├── My child folder 1│      └── sublevela.html│   ├── My child folder 2│      └── sublevelb.html Tip: When you’re creating new levels, it’s easiest to copy the correct formatting and then adjust the values. Use the sample formatting included in the generic.yml file to copy and paste new levels. If you get the spacing wrong, when Jekyll builds the project, it will usually throw an error and note a mapping problem in your YAML file.Customize the Header",

To fix this, edit your config file and change the port to a unique number.If the previous server wasn’t shut down properly, you can kill the server process using these commands:ps aux | grep jekyllFind the PID (for example, it  looks like “22298”).Then type kill -9 22298 where “22298” is the PID.Alternatively, type the following to stop all Jekyll servers:kill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')shell file not executableIf you run into permissions errors trying to run a shell script file (such as jekyllhowto-multibuild_web.sh), you may need to change the file permissions to make the sh file executable. Browse to the directory containing the shell script and run the following:chmod +x build_writer.shshell file not runnableIf you’re using a PC, rename your shell files with a .bat extension.“page 0” cross references in the PDFIf you see “page 0” cross-references in the PDF, the URL doesn’t exist. Check to make sure you actually included this page in the build.If it’s not a page but rather a file, you need to add a noExtIcon class to the file so that your print stylesheet excludes the counter from it. Add class=\"noExtIcon\" as an attribute to the link.The PDF is blankCheck the prince-list.txt file in the output to see if it contains links. If not, you have something wrong with the logic in the prince-list.txt file. Check the conditions.html file in your _includes to see if the audience specified in your configuration file aligns with the buildAudience in the conditions.html fileSidebar not appearingIf you build your site but the sidebar doesn’t appear, check that your page has a sidebar property in the frontmatter that corresponds with a sidebar in the _data folder.Sidebar isn’t collapsedIf the sidebar levels aren’t collapsed, usually your JavaScript is broken somewhere. Open the JavaScript Console and look to see where the problem is. If one script breaks, then other scripts will break too, so troubleshooting it is a little tricky.Search isn’t workingIf the search isn’t working, check the JSON validity in the search.json file in your output folder. Usually something is invalid. Identify the problematic line, fix the file, or put search: exclude in the frontmatter of the file to exclude it from search.Links not workingMake sure you add {% include links.html %} at the bottom of each page. Make sure your sidebar is listed in the sidebars property in your configuration file.Links include isn’t working correctlyIf you look at your HTML output and see that the links.html include at the bottom is leaving all the Markdown reference tags in the output, something is wrong with your Markdown or HTML syntax on the page. As a result, the Markdown might stop rendering.For example, look at your HTML tables. If there is one tiny formatting issue (a tag not properly closed), kramdown will stop working on the file and won’t convert any other content in the file. The Markdown reference tags are just evidence that the Markdown filter stopped converting the file to HTML at this point. Fix the HTML and the Markdown will properly convert to HTML.Building Someone Else’s ProjectWhen you build someone else’s project, if the person has a Gem and Gemfile, you might get errors like this:WARN: Unresolved specs during Gem::Specification.reset:      rouge (~&gt; 1.7)      jekyll-watch (~&gt; 1.1)WARN: Clearing out unresolved specs.This is because the person had different version of Ruby gems on their computer, which get packaged into a Gemfile.First run bundler to make sure the gem versions on your computer match those of the project. From the project’s directory, run the following:bundle installThen run this:jekyll serve --config configs/jekyll_english.ymlNow you can press Ctrl+C and run . jekyll.sh as usual.Checking the version of JekyllYou can see what version of Jekyll you have by running the following:jekyll -version",

  "content": "The Amazon Pay and Login with Amazon product consists of the Amazon Pay and the Login with Amazon services, which are technically closely related and run on the same platform.  Amazon Pay is a checkout option that lets the buyer choose a shipping address and payment method that is stored in their Amazon user account.  Login with Amazon encourages your buyer to sign in using their Amazon login credentials when they arrive on your home page.When the buyer successfully signs in to Amazon, an access token is returned. The access token is specific to your client and buyer and the type of profile data you are requesting. You will need the access token to retrieve customer profile data.  Procedure  Complete code sampleProcedureNote: You must encode your data before processing. We recommend that you encode any data that you receive from us before outputting it in any form, like HTML, JavaScript, or in a URL. Output encoding ensures that malicious scripts or any other injected executable cannot be executed on your website. For additional details, see “Encode your data before processing” in the JavaScript section.Follow the steps below to add a button widget for buyer authentication. Do the steps in the order presented. In particular, you must not add the widgets.js script (step 2) before completing step 1. A complete code sample is offered at the end of this topic.Add callback for onAmazonLoginReady and onAmazonPaymentsReady to the &lt;head&gt; section of any page where you want the button to appear. The onAmazonPaymentsReady callback will render the button.&lt;head&gt;  &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;    window.onAmazonLoginReady = function() {      amazon.Login.setClientId('CLIENT-ID');    };    window.onAmazonPaymentsReady = function() {                showButton();    };  &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/head&gt;For more information, see “Adding callback and widget.js code to your web pages” in the JavaScript section.Add the widget.js file below the callback functions.&lt;head&gt;  &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;    window.onAmazonLoginReady = function() {      amazon.Login.setClientId('CLIENT-ID');    };    window.onAmazonPaymentsReady = function() {                showButton();    };  &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;script async=\"async\" src='https://static-na.payments-amazon.com/OffAmazonPayments/us/sandbox/js/Widgets.js'&gt;  &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/head&gt;The script tag in the sample above contains an async attribute that allows the web page to load more quickly while the JavaScript code required by Amazon Pay is loaded in the background. This is the only asynchronous method supported by Amazon Pay.Add the button code to the body of your web page by adding JavaScript code in the &lt;body&gt; of every page where you want the button to appear. &lt;div id=\"AmazonPayButton\"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  ... &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;    function showButton(){      var authRequest;       OffAmazonPayments.Button(\"AmazonPayButton\", \"SELLER-ID\", {         type:  \"TYPE\",         color: \"COLOR\",         size:  \"SIZE\",         authorization: function() {         loginOptions = {scope: \"SCOPES\",           popup: \"POPUP-PARAMETER\"};         authRequest = amazon.Login.authorize (loginOptions,           \"REDIRECT-URL\");         }   }); &lt;/script&gt;The code sample above shows parameters that you can replace with your own values.
